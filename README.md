Getting and Cleaning Data
=========================

Repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data course @ Coursera.

In order to execute the run_analysis.R script, you need to set the current working directory in a folder containing the
following files:

- activity_labels.txt
- features.txt
- subject_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- X_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- y_test.txt
- X_test.txt

The output of the run_analysis.R script is a file named tidydata.txt.
